😵 The Problem We're Solving
🍝 API Spaghetti
Modern enterprises have 100+ APIs. Each query requires multiple API calls with complex joining logic.
🏗️ Hardcoded Chaos
Adding new APIs means rewriting tons of conditional logic. Maintenance nightmare!
🤷 Poor User Experience
Users need to know which APIs to call and how to join data. Too technical!
⚡ Scaling Impossible
Each new API integration creates exponential complexity. Teams avoid adding new services.

📊 Real-World Pain Point
User Query: "Who is the account owner of project 111811 and are they on leave?"
Traditional Approach:
1. Call Seal API to get project details
2. Extract account_owner_id from response  
3. Call Employee API with account_owner_id
4. Extract employee details
5. Call Leaves API with employee_id
6. Manually format and join all responses
7. Handle errors at each step
Lines of Code: ~200 lines
Maintenance: Add new API = Rewrite everything
Developer Experience: 😭
Result: Developers spend 60% of time on API orchestration instead of business logic!

Detailed Timeline
Time: 14:30:00.000 - Lambda A starts
├─ Lambda A queries: find({ status: "scheduled", scheduledTime: { $lte: now } })
├─ Lambda A gets: [broadcast1]
├─ Lambda A begins processing broadcast1...
│
Time: 14:30:00.100 - Lambda B starts (100ms later)
├─ Lambda B queries: find({ status: "scheduled", scheduledTime: { $lte: now } })
├─ Lambda B ALSO gets: [broadcast1]  // ← PROBLEM! Status is STILL "scheduled"
├─ Lambda B begins processing broadcast1...
│
Time: 14:30:00.200 - Lambda A updates status
├─ Lambda A: updateOne({ broadcastId: "broadcast1" }, { status: "processing" })
│
Time: 14:30:00.250 - Lambda B updates status  
└─ Lambda B: updateOne({ broadcastId: "broadcast1" }, { status: "processing" })

RESULT: Both Lambdas are now processing the same broadcast!
Why The Second Lambda Sees The Same Data
The Critical Gap
javascript// Lambda A process:
async function processWithoutLocking() {
    // Step 1: Query (at 14:30:00.000)
    const broadcasts = await db.find({ 
        status: "scheduled" 
    });  // Returns: [broadcast1]
    
    // Step 2: Process each broadcast
    for (const broadcast of broadcasts) {
        // ⚠️ CRITICAL GAP HERE - Status not yet updated!
        // Other Lambdas can still see this as "scheduled"
        
        await sendToRecipients(broadcast);  // Takes 200ms
        
        // Step 3: Update status (at 14:30:00.200)
        await db.updateOne(
            { broadcastId: broadcast.broadcastId },
            { $set: { status: "processing" } }
        );
    }
}

// Lambda B queries during the "CRITICAL GAP" 
// between Lambda A's query and update
Real Example: Email Duplication
javascript// Broadcast configuration
{
  broadcastId: "welcome-email-123",
  scheduledTime: "14:25:00",
  status: "scheduled",
  template: "welcome_new_users",
  recipients: ["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
}

// Lambda A (14:30:00.000)
1. Queries and finds welcome-email-123
2. Loads template
3. Sends email to user1@example.com ✉️
4. Sends email to user2@example.com ✉️
5. Updates status to "completed"

// Lambda B (14:30:00.100) - Started before A finished
1. Queries and finds welcome-email-123 (still "scheduled"!)
2. Loads template
3. Sends email to user1@example.com ✉️ (DUPLICATE!)
4. Sends email to user2@example.com ✉️ (DUPLICATE!)
5. Tries to update status (might fail or overwrite)

// Result: Each user gets 2 welcome emails!
Why Multiple Lambdas Start
1. AWS Lambda Scaling
EventBridge Rule Triggers
    ↓
AWS Lambda sees request
    ↓
Lambda: "I'll spawn multiple containers for better performance"
    ↓
Container 1: Processes broadcasts
Container 2: Also processes broadcasts (for parallelism)
Container 3: Also processes broadcasts (for parallelism)
2. Retry Mechanism
javascript// EventBridge retry configuration
{
  "Targets": [{
    "Arn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123:function:broadcast-processor",
    "RetryPolicy": {
      "MaximumRetryAttempts": 2,
      "MaximumEventAge": 3600
    }
  }]
}

// Scenario: Network glitch
Attempt 1: Lambda A starts, processes broadcast1, network timeout
EventBridge: "Hmm, that failed, let me retry"
Attempt 2: Lambda B starts, queries again, broadcast1 still "scheduled"!
Result: Broadcast1 processed twice
Visual Representation
WITHOUT LOCKING:
                    MongoDB Status
Time    Lambda A              Lambda B            broadcast1
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
14:30:00.000  Query DB           -               "scheduled"
14:30:00.050  Get broadcast1     -               "scheduled"
14:30:00.100  Processing...      Query DB        "scheduled" ← B sees it!
14:30:00.150  Processing...      Get broadcast1  "scheduled"
14:30:00.200  Update status      Processing...   "processing"
14:30:00.250  Done              Update status    "processing"

Result: Both processed broadcast1!

WITH LOCKING (atomic operation):
                    MongoDB Status
Time    Lambda A              Lambda B            broadcast1
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
14:30:00.000  FindAndUpdate      -               "scheduled"→"processing"
14:30:00.050  Get broadcast1     -               "processing" (locked by A)
14:30:00.100  Processing...      FindAndUpdate   "processing" (locked)
14:30:00.150  Processing...      Gets nothing    "processing"
14:30:00.200  Done              Exits           "completed"

Result: Only Lambda A processes broadcast1!
The Fix: Atomic Locking
javascript// Instead of separate query + update
async function processWithAtomicLocking() {
    while (true) {
        // Atomic operation - query and update in ONE operation
        const broadcast = await db.findOneAndUpdate(
            { 
                status: "scheduled",
                scheduledTime: { $lte: now }
            },
            {
                $set: { 
                    status: "processing",
                    lockedBy: context.requestId,
                    lockedAt: new Date()
                }
            },
            {
                returnDocument: 'after'
            }
        );
        
        if (!broadcast) break; // No more scheduled broadcasts
        
        // Now safe to process - no other Lambda can get this
        await processBroadcast(broadcast);
    }
}
Why 288 Rules Don't Have This Problem
javascript// Lambda A - Rule: broadcast_slot_1430
const broadcasts = await db.find({
    'schedule.assignedSlot': '1430',  // ONLY 14:30 broadcasts
    'status': 'scheduled'
});

// Lambda B - Rule: broadcast_slot_1435  
const broadcasts = await db.find({
    'schedule.assignedSlot': '1435',  // ONLY 14:35 broadcasts
    'status': 'scheduled'
});

// Different slots = Different broadcasts = No overlap = No duplicates!
The key insight: The time between "reading" and "updating" creates a race condition window where multiple Lambdas can read the same "scheduled" broadcast before any of them updates it to "processing".RetrySwhy lambda a and b will get called at same timeEditExcellent question! Let me explain the various scenarios where Lambda A and B can be called at the same time with the 1 rule approach:
Why Multiple Lambdas Start Simultaneously
1. EventBridge Retry Logic
javascript// EventBridge Configuration
{
  "Rule": "broadcast-poller",
  "Schedule": "rate(5 minutes)",
  "Targets": [{
    "Arn": "lambda:broadcast-processor",
    "RetryPolicy": {
      "MaximumRetryAttempts": 2,
      "MaximumEventAge": 3600
    }
  }]
}

// Scenario: Network timeout
14:30:00 - EventBridge triggers Lambda A
14:30:05 - Lambda A times out (network issue)
14:30:06 - EventBridge detects failure, triggers Lambda B (retry)
14:30:06 - Lambda A actually recovers and continues!

// Now BOTH are running!
2. Lambda Concurrency Settings
javascript// Lambda Configuration
{
  "FunctionName": "broadcast-processor",
  "ReservedConcurrentExecutions": 100,  // Can run 100 instances
  "ProvisionedConcurrencyConfig": {
    "AllocatedConcurrentExecutions": 10  // 10 pre-warmed
  }
}

// If EventBridge has any issue:
14:30:00.000 - EventBridge sends invoke request
14:30:00.001 - Network hiccup
14:30:00.100 - EventBridge retries (thinks first failed)
14:30:00.101 - First request actually arrives too

// AWS Lambda receives BOTH requests!
3. EventBridge Delivery Guarantees
EventBridge provides "At Least Once" delivery, not "Exactly Once"

This means:
- EventBridge might invoke Lambda multiple times for same event
- Network issues can cause duplicate invocations
- No built-in deduplication
4. Lambda Execution Time Overlap
14:25:00 - Rule triggers Lambda A
14:25:01 - Lambda A starts processing (takes 6 minutes due to high load)
14:30:00 - Rule triggers again (5 min interval)
14:30:01 - Lambda B starts (Lambda A still running!)

Both are now running simultaneously!
Real-World Scenarios
Scenario 1: Slow Processing
javascript// Lambda timeout: 15 minutes
// Processing time varies based on broadcast size

Timeline:
14:25:00 - Lambda A triggered
14:25:01 - Lambda A: Processing 100,000 recipients (slow)
14:30:00 - EventBridge: "Time for next run!"
14:30:01 - Lambda B triggered
14:30:02 - Lambda B: Queries DB, finds same broadcasts!
         - (Lambda A hasn't marked them complete yet)
Scenario 2: Lambda Service Issues
AWS Lambda occasionally has:
- Cold start delays
- Throttling
- Container reuse issues

Example:
14:30:00.000 - EventBridge invokes
14:30:00.100 - Lambda service throttled
14:30:00.500 - EventBridge timeout/retry
14:30:00.600 - Both invocations accepted
Scenario 3: Distributed Systems Reality
javascript// EventBridge is distributed across multiple AZs
AZ-1: EventBridge Node 1 triggers at 14:30:00.000
AZ-2: EventBridge Node 2 triggers at 14:30:00.050 (clock drift)

// Both think they're the "correct" invocation
// Lambda receives both
Proof: CloudWatch Logs
# Real logs showing duplicate invocations
2024-01-25T14:30:00.123Z START RequestId: abc-123-lambda-A
2024-01-25T14:30:00.145Z [abc-123] Querying broadcasts...
2024-01-25T14:30:00.234Z START RequestId: xyz-789-lambda-B  ← Second Lambda!
2024-01-25T14:30:00.256Z [xyz-789] Querying broadcasts...
2024-01-25T14:30:00.267Z [abc-123] Found 50 broadcasts
2024-01-25T14:30:00.289Z [xyz-789] Found 50 broadcasts  ← Same broadcasts!
AWS Documentation Evidence
From AWS EventBridge docs:

"EventBridge attempts to deliver an event to a target at least once. In rare cases, the same event may be delivered more than once."

From AWS Lambda docs:

"Your Lambda function code must be idempotent, capable of handling the same event multiple times."

Why This is Less Common with 288 Rules
javascript// With 288 rules, even if duplicates happen:

// Lambda A (duplicate of slot 14:30)
db.find({ assignedSlot: "1430" })  // Gets broadcasts 1,2,3

// Lambda B (duplicate of slot 14:30)  
db.find({ assignedSlot: "1430" })  // Gets same 1,2,3

// BUT: These are exact duplicates of the SAME slot
// Easier to handle with message deduplication

// With 1 rule:
// Lambda A: Gets ALL broadcasts from 14:00-14:30 (hundreds)
// Lambda B: Gets overlapping set based on timing
// Much harder to deduplicate
Preventing Duplicate Invocations
Option 1: Idempotency Key
javascriptexports.handler = async (event, context) => {
    const invocationId = event.id || context.requestId;
    
    // Check if we've processed this invocation
    const processed = await db.collection('invocations').findOne({
        invocationId: invocationId
    });
    
    if (processed) {
        console.log('Duplicate invocation, skipping');
        return;
    }
    
    // Record this invocation
    await db.collection('invocations').insertOne({
        invocationId: invocationId,
        timestamp: new Date()
    });
    
    // Now process...
};
Option 2: SQS FIFO Queue
javascript// Use SQS FIFO instead of direct Lambda invocation
{
  "EventBridge Rule": "broadcast-poller",
  "Target": "SQS FIFO Queue",  // Not Lambda directly
  "MessageDeduplicationId": "timestamp",
  "MessageGroupId": "broadcast-processor"
}

// SQS FIFO guarantees exactly-once delivery
Summary
Multiple Lambdas get called simultaneously because:

EventBridge guarantees "at least once" delivery (not exactly once)
Network issues cause retries while original is still running
Long-running Lambdas overlap with next scheduled run
AWS Lambda scaling can accept duplicate invocations
Distributed systems have inherent timing uncertainties

This is why the 1 rule approach needs complex locking logic, while 288 rules naturally partition work to minimize the impact of these duplications.
