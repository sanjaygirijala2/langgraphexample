😵 The Problem We're Solving
🍝 API Spaghetti
Modern enterprises have 100+ APIs. Each query requires multiple API calls with complex joining logic.
🏗️ Hardcoded Chaos
Adding new APIs means rewriting tons of conditional logic. Maintenance nightmare!
🤷 Poor User Experience
Users need to know which APIs to call and how to join data. Too technical!
⚡ Scaling Impossible
Each new API integration creates exponential complexity. Teams avoid adding new services.

📊 Real-World Pain Point
User Query: "Who is the account owner of project 111811 and are they on leave?"
Traditional Approach:
1. Call Seal API to get project details
2. Extract account_owner_id from response  
3. Call Employee API with account_owner_id
4. Extract employee details
5. Call Leaves API with employee_id
6. Manually format and join all responses
7. Handle errors at each step
Lines of Code: ~200 lines
Maintenance: Add new API = Rewrite everything
Developer Experience: 😭
Result: Developers spend 60% of time on API orchestration instead of business logic!
